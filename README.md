Retail Sales by Town in 2012 KPI

The first KPI that is chosen is the total retail sales by town in 2012. The total retail sales are sorted by each town. The KPI is filter to the top 10 towns with the highest retail total sales. This means that Stratford is the highest performing town in Connecticut in 2012.
I also wanted to figure out whether the stores in thoses towns are high perfominhg. I then create a lookup table named Performance by Town and I sorted the the total sales into four categories. The categories are Low, Acceptable, Good and Exceleent. The excellent performing towns are the towns I want to expand to a new store.

Retail Sales by Town in 2013

The second KPI is the same as the first KPI but in year 2013. The filtering is the same. East Hartford is the highest performing Town.
Vlookup is ueesd. The lookup table has been created from scratch. It was not provided on the dataset The cloums created was also not provided so it was created from scratch.

Real Estate Sales by Property Type

This KPI determines the most expensive property type for all the towns. Residential is the most expensive property type. Then commercial than apartments. Therefore, the property type where people living such as residential and apartments will be a big priority to find the most expensive town.

The third KPI is determines the highest total real estate sales in each town. This gives a clue on whether a town is expensive. When a town is expensive, people in those towns have more money, therefore would spend more money. Thye graphs are filtered by the top ten towns with the most real estate sales. Greenwich is the most expensive town.

I want to figure out with a toen is expenisive or cheap. I also wanted to figure out whether the stores in thoses towns are high perfominhg. I then create a lookup table named  Townâ€™s home valueand I sorted the the total sales into four categories. The categories are Low, Acceptable, Good and Exceleent. The excellent performing towns are the towns I want to expand to a new store.


KPI 4 Total Assessed Real Estate Value by Year

The assessed value is the value that the properties get before the sales have been completed. This KPI determines if towns are getting more expensive before completed the sales. The assessed value has been trending upward. This gives first impressions on whether a town is expensive or cheap place to live. This upward trend means the towns in Connecticut are getting more expensive.

The 5 towns that will be chose
The five towns that will be chosen will be in the order of priority.
The best town to pick is Stamford. Stamford is the town that is near the top in both retail sales and real estate sales. It is one of the most expensive towns and the high total and average real estate sales shows that people here have money and will spend money. Stamford has always constantly a more expensive city therefore, people have always had more money and will spend it for many years to come. Stamford is a great first choice to open a new location.
Another town to pick is Danbury. Danbury is in the top 3 in total and average retail sales. Danbury is not as expensive as Stamford. So, Stamford gets a slight edge because its constantly more expensive because Stamford has a higher average real estate sale. Danbury has a chance to slightly underperform in the future if Danbury becomes cheap place to live. But the high total and average sales proved that it will not happen anytime soon. That is why Danbury is the 2nd choice to open a new location.
Norwalk will be another town to pick. Norwalk is in the top 10 in both total and average retail sales. Norwalk is in the top five in toral real estate sales therefore it is expensive town and people have money. Because Norwalk has a lower average real estate sale. There is a chance of the store in that town to underperform if Norwalk becomes a cheap town to live which can happen. Because it is in the top 8, it will not happen right away. Therefore, Norwalk is the 3rd choice to open a new location.
Greenwich will be another town to pick. Greenwich is the most expensive town in Connecticut. Greenwich also has the highest average real estate sales so Greenwich will stay expensive for years to come. People in that town have a lot of money to spend. Greenwich stores are performing well but not like the top 4 stores in the towns that was listed. This means not everyone in Greenwich will spend money at a sports store. Greenwich on the retail sales list proves that Greenwich has the potential to have highest total and average retail sales in the future. Therefore, Greenwich is a good 4th choice to open a new location.
 
Bridgeport is another town to pick. The total and average retail sales is in the top ten. It is the top ten in total real estate sales, so it is an expensive town. The average real estate sales in not high so the town can get cheap eventually. Bridgeport has a chance to underperform but not badly to the point where there is no need for expansion. That is why Bridgeport is 5th choice to open a new location.
The total and average retail estate sales started to trend upwards since so the all the towns will become more expensive. Will not focus on past 2016 because 2012 and 2013 years are a priority because that is the years the retail sales data is in. So that is the five towns that is chosen to open a new store in
